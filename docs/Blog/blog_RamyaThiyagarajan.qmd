## Introduction

In this blog post, I will introduce the dashboard I created to explore bone health data, specifically focusing on parameters like Bone Mineral Density (BMD), Bone Mineral Content (BMC), and the impact of those parameters resulting in osteoporosis.

In this post, I will walk you through the process of creating the dashboard, the hypotheses I tested, and their results.

## Basic Information on Osteoporosis

Before diving deep into my analysis, I want to provide some basic terminologies used in this analysis.

Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become brittle and are prone to breaking.  
BMD refers to Bone Mineral Density and BMC refers to Bone Mineral Content.

## Building the Dashboard

Building the dashboard involved several key steps, from importing and cleaning the data to performing analyses and visualizing the results.

1. **Data Cleaning**: For my analysis, I used the NHANES data from the categories of demographics, examination, and questionnaires. All relevant data from these categories were chosen for the analysis of osteoporosis, specifically in the spine region. Then, I combined all the data and treated missing values using the `mice` library.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: I performed several types of statistical tests, including paired and independent t-tests, to compare the impact/relevance of bone parameters between osteoporosis-affected patients and patients without osteoporosis. I also built linear regression models to predict Bone Mineral Density (BMD) based on various factors.

3. **Visualization**: The data was visualized through interactive plots like box plots and histograms, using Plotly to allow for dynamic exploration of the results.

4. **Dashboard Integration**: The dashboard was built with an emphasis on interactivity, allowing users to explore different bone parameters and their relationships with osteoporosis history.

## Hypotheses and Analyses

The primary hypothesis tested was that there would be a significant difference in bone parameters (such as BMD, Spine area, and BMC) between individuals with and without osteoporosis. The analysis was based on the following steps:

1. **Paired Samples Analysis**: I compared the mean difference between Spine BMD and Spine BMC, using a paired t-test to assess whether these two parameters are significantly different.

2. **Independent Samples Analysis**: I compared Spine BMD between individuals with and without osteoporosis using an independent t-test to see if osteoporosis status influenced bone health.

3. **Regression Analysis**: I built linear regression models to predict Spine BMD based on different demographic and bone-related factors.

4. **Cross-tabulation & Chi-Square**: I also explored relationships between BMD and BMC categories using chi-square tests and mosaic plots.

## Results

### Paired Samples Analysis
The paired t-test revealed a significant difference between Spine BMD and Spine BMC, with a strong relationship between the two parameters. The t-statistic indicated that the difference is statistically significant.

### Independent Samples Analysis
For individuals with osteoporosis, the average BMD was significantly lower than those without osteoporosis. The boxplot visualization clearly showed the difference in medians between the two groups.

### Regression Models
The regression models showed that osteoporosis history, gender, and spine area were significant predictors of Spine BMD. The full model explained about 36% of the variability in BMD, which is a strong result for this type of medical data.

### Cross-Tabulation Results
The chi-square test indicated a significant correlation between BMD and BMC categories, showing that higher BMD is associated with higher BMC.

## Conclusions

The analysis confirmed what one might conclude intuitively: people with osteoporosis history will have low bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). Also, the relationship between bone mineral density and bone mineral content is positively correlated. This makes sense too, as females are more prone to osteoporosis than men. This conclusion is significant for the sample I worked with.

## Personal Reflection

Building this dashboard was challenging for me, as I don't have any prior experience working with it. Figuring out how to understand the different components and ways to implement them was both challenging and exciting. But, in the end, I learned a lot and I am looking forward to creating more useful tools to publish my personal research analysis.

I would extend this study to incorporate the effects of genetics in getting affected by osteoporosis. Additionally, this study is specific to the spine, so I would like to include other bone types in my future analysis.
