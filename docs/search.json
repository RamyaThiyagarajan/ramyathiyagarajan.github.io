All relevant data from these categories were chosen for the analysis of osteoporosis, specifically in the spine region. Then, I combined all the data and treated missing values using the mice library.\nStatistical Analysis: I performed several types of statistical tests, including paired and independent t-tests, to compare the impact/relevance of bone parameters between osteoporosis-affected patients and patients without osteoporosis. I also built linear regression models to predict Bone Mineral Density (BMD) based on various factors.\nVisualization: The data was visualized through interactive plots like box plots and histograms, using Plotly to allow for dynamic exploration of the results.\nDashboard Integration: The dashboard was built with an emphasis on interactivity, allowing users to explore different bone parameters and their relationships with osteoporosis history."

The boxplot visualization clearly showed the difference in medians between the two groups.\n\n\nRegression Models\nThe regression models showed that osteoporosis history, gender, and spine area were significant predictors of Spine BMD. The full model explained about 36% of the variability in BMD, which is a strong result for this type of medical data.\n\n\nCross-Tabulation Results\nThe chi-square test indicated a significant correlation between BMD and BMC categories, showing that higher BMD is associated with higher BMC."

This conclusion is significant for the sample I worked with."
